# Color Time Generator

**Color Time Generator** is a responsive and dynamic web application that features a real-time countdown timer synchronized across all connected users using Socket.IO. The application offers a bilingual interface (English and French) and allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. The timer resets every hour and decrements in sync with the server's time.

## Features

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Countdown timer is synchronized across all connected clients using Socket.IO.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Language Toggle**: Choose between English and French languages.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the countdown with dynamic color changes based on progress.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly across different devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager for managing dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-time-generator.git
   cd color-time-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### File Structure

- **`/public`**: Contains static files like stylesheets, scripts, and images.
  - **`stylesheets/`**: CSS and Bootstrap files.
  - **`javascripts/`**: JavaScript files including Alpine.js and Socket.IO client.
- **`/server`**: Contains the server-side code.
  - **`socketService.js`**: Handles Socket.IO connections and timer logic.
  - **`index.js`**: Main server file that initializes the application.
- **`/helpers`**: Utility functions used in the server.
- **`/views`**: HTML templates rendered by the server.

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Timer**: The server runs a timer that resets every hour. The timer is synchronized with the server's `new Date().getTime()` and is broadcasted to all connected clients.
  
2. **Theme and Language Toggle**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes, and switch between English and French using the provided buttons. The settings are stored in `localStorage` to persist across sessions.

3. **Dynamic Interface**: The progress bar updates in real-time based on the countdown value and changes color to indicate different stages of the countdown.

### Customization

- **Translations**: Modify `bodyTexts.js` to add or change text content for different languages.
- **Styling**: Edit the CSS files in `/public/stylesheets/` to customize the look and feel.

### Dependencies

- **Alpine.js**: For lightweight, reactive components.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
